  # THE QUESTION AT HAND: why does price alone make the most sense to me?
  # because of how you call it inline: OrderItem.price.
  # to me, *OrderItem.price* says: what's the price of this item?
  # it does not say to me: what's the price of the things that make up this item.
  # if my item is a six-pack of beer, I expect to see the price for the whole six-pack.
