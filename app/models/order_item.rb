  # this scope is unecessary, because product.order_items can be used.
  # order_items_controller's #more will need to be rewritten to use the right syntax & to not reinvent the wheel.

  # this should probably be in helpers/order_items_helpers
  # if this is only going to be used in the cart, maybe just use it inline inside the view
